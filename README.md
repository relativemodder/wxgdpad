# PLEASE HELP US TO WRITE COMPLETE GUIDE HOW TO BUILD THIS TOOL ON LINUX



WIP


## Dependencies on Linux

- cmake
- gcc
- fmt
- wxwidgets

If you're on Debian-based systems you should install -dev versions of the above packages for building it.

uhh...

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc cmake libfmt-dev build-essential
```



## Building on Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/relativemodder/wxgdpad
cd wxgdpad
cmake -Bbuild
cmake --build build
```


**Boom!**
